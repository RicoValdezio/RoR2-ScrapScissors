Basic Description
------------
This mod includes one new item: Rusty Scissors which is based loosely on the Rusted Key from RoR2 and the 56-Leaf Clover from RoR1.
When a monster is killed while this is in the inventory, a random amount of "scrap" will be given to the player (this is currently hidden).
When the player reaches 100 scrap, they are given a random item from the Sacrifice loot table.

Base Math Breakdown
------------
- Basic monsters give 3 scrap
- Elites give 2 times the base amount
- Bosses give 5 times the base amount
- These amounts can vary by 20% in either direction
- The above values are all configurable
- Each stack gives an additional luck check and 2 extra items per stage

Known Issues/Planned Updates
------------
- A UI element is planned, just need to figure that out
